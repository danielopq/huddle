## Overview

I developed a responsive landing page for a community website, carefully optimizing it for both desktop and mobile users. All elements are arranged to match the provided design specifications, ensuring consistency and visual appeal across devices. The layout is built entirely with HTML and CSS, using flexbox and grid techniques to achieve a structured and adaptable design. Each section is tailored for an intuitive user experience, creating a seamless flow for users as they navigate the site. No external frameworks or libraries were used in this project, making it lightweight and efficient.
